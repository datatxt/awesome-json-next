# Awesome JSON - What's Next? 

A Collection of What's Next for Awesome JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for structured (meta) data in text.


#### _Contributions welcome. Anything missing? Send in a pull request. Thanks._


## What's Missing in JSON?

1. Comments, Comments, Comments
2. Unquoted Keys
3. Multi-Line Strings 
   - a) Folded -- Folds Newlines 
   - b) Unfolded
4. Trailing Commas in Arrays and Objects


More:

- Date/DateTime/Timestamp Type
- Optional Commas
- Optional Unquoted String Values
- "Raw" String (e.g. `''` instead of `""`) 
  - No need to escape `\` or `"` etc. To escape `'` use `'''` e.g. `''''Henry's Themes'''`
- More Data Types (`set`, `map`, `symbol`, etc.)
- And much more

### JSON5 

_Modern JSON - JSON for the ES5 Era_

web: [json5.org](http://json5.org),
github: [json5](https://github.com/json5)

JSON for "Humans" (not Machines). Adds:

- Comments- Allow both inline (single-line) and block (multi-line) comments are allowed (like ES5)
- Keys can be unquoted if they're valid identifiers e.g. a-z0-9 (like ES5)
- Single and double quoted strings (like ES5)
- Allows multi-line string with backslash (like ES5)
- Allow trailing commas for arrays and objects.
- And some more.

```
// This file is written in JSON5 syntax, naturally, but npm needs a regular
// JSON file, so compile via `npm run build`. Be sure to keep both in sync!

    },
}
```

### HJSON

_A "Human" User Interface for JSON_

web: [hjson.org](http://hjson.org),
github: [hjson](https://github.com/hjson)

- Commas Optional
- Add comments, hash-style (#), line-style (//) and block-style (/* */)
- Allow Keys without quotes
- Allow Strings without quotes
- Allow Multi-line strings Python-style e.g. ''' text '''

```
{
  // use #, // or /**/ comments,
  // omit quotes for keys
  key: 1
  // omit quotes for strings
  contains: everything on this line
  // omit commas at the end of a line
  cool: {
    foo: 1
    bar: 2
  }
  // allow trailing commas
  list: [
    1,
    2,
  ]
  // and use multiline strings
  realist:
    '''
    My half empty glass,
    I will fill your empty half.
    Now you are half full.
    '''
}
```


### HanSON 

_JSON for Humans_

github: [timjansen/hanson](https://github.com/timjansen/hanson)

Adds:

- HanSON is JSON with comments, multi-line strings and unquoted property names.
- Comments use JavaScript syntax (`//`, `/**/`).
- Supports backticks as quotes (\`\`) for multi-line strings.
- You can use either double-quotes (`""`) or single-quotes (`''`) for single-line strings.
- Property names do not require quotes if they are valid JavaScript identifiers.
- Commas after the last list element or property will be ignored.
- Every JSON string is valid HanSON.
- HanSON can easily be converted to real JSON.


```js
{
  listName: "Sesame Street Monsters", // note that listName needs no quotes
  content: [
    {
      name: "Cookie Monster",
      /* Note the template quotes and unescaped regular quotes in the next string */
      background: `Cookie Monster used to be a
monster that ate everything, especially cookies.
These days he is forced to eat "healthy" food.`
    }, {
      // You can single-quote strings too:
      name: 'Herry Monster',
      background: `Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.
He's mostly retired today.`
    },    // don't worry, the trailing comma will be ignored
   ]
}
```


### SON

_Simple Object Notation_

github: [aleksandergurin/simple-object-notation](https://github.com/aleksandergurin/simple-object-notation)

Adds:

- comments starts with # sign and ends with newline (\n)
- comma after a key-value pair is optional
- comma after an array element is optional

```
{
  # Personal information
    
  "name": "Alexander Grothendieck"
  "fields": "mathematics"
  "main_topics": [
    "Etale cohomology"
    "Motives"
    "Topos theory"
    "Schemes"
  ]
}
```


### JSONX

_JSON with Extensions (JSONX) or JSON v1.1 (a.k.a. JSON11 or JSON XI or JSON II) - JSON Evolved for Humans - Easy-to-Write, Easy-to-Read_

github: [jsonii](https://github.com/jsonii)

JSON v1.1 includes all JSON extensions from HanSON (JSON for Humans):

- quotes for strings are optional if they follow JavaScript identifier rules.
- you can alternatively use backticks, as in ES6's template string literal, as quotes for strings.
  A backtick-quoted string may span several lines and you are not required to escape regular quote characters,
  only backticks. Backslashes still need to be escaped, and all other backslash-escape sequences work like in
  regular JSON.
- for single-line strings, single quotes (`''`) are supported in addition to double quotes (`""`)
- you can use JavaScript comments, both single line (`//`) and multi-line comments (`/* */`), in all places where JSON allows whitespace.
- Commas after the last list element or object property will be ignored.

Plus all JSON extensions from SON (Simple Object Notation):

- comments starts with `#` sign and ends with newline (`\n`)
- comma after an object key-value pair is optional
- comma after an array item is optional


Example:

```
{
  #  use shell-like comments

  listName: "Sesame Street Monsters"   # note: comments after key-value pairs are optional  
  content: [
    {
      name: "Cookie Monster"
      // note: the template quotes and unescaped regular quotes in the next string
      background: `Cookie Monster used to be a
monster that ate everything, especially cookies.
These days he is forced to eat "healthy" food.`
    }, {
      // You can single-quote strings too:
      name: 'Herry Monster',
      background: `Herry Monster is a furry blue monster with a purple nose.
He's mostly retired today.`
    },    /* don't worry, the trailing comma will be ignored  */
   ]
}
```


### CSON

_CoffeeScript-Object-Notation. Same as JSON but for CoffeeScript objects_

github: [bevry/cson](https://github.com/bevry/cson)

CSON:

``` coffeescript

### USON

_μson - A compact human-readable data serialization format specially designed for shell_

github: [burningtree/uson](https://github.com/burningtree/uson)

Principles:

- Superset of JSON (every JSON is valid μson).
- Whitespace is not significant.
- String quoting `"` is optional.
- In Array or Object, comma `,` can be replaced by whitespace ` `.
- Assignation with colon `:` can be repeated to create nested objects.
- You can use own types, casting is done by `!` character.

USON:

```
number:12.05 text:Banana quotedText:"John Devilseed" empty:null good:true
```

same as:

```json
{
  "number": 12.05,
  "text": "Banana",
  "quotedText": "John Devilseed",
  "empty": null,
  "good": true
}
```

USON:

```
simple:[1 2 3] texts:[Malta Budapest "New York"] objects:[{id:1}]
```

same as:

```json
{
  "simple": [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "texts": [
    "Malta",
    "Budapest",
    "New York"
  ],
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```



## JSON is the New CSV - JSON Formats for Line-Oriented Tables / Records 

_One Line, One Data Record_

[JSON Lines](#json-lines) •
[NDJSON ](#ndjson) 


### JSON Lines

web: [jsonlines.org](http://jsonlines.org)

One Line, One Record - Newline (nl or \n) Separated

```
["Name", "Session", "Score", "Completed"]
["Gilbert", "2013", 24, true]
["Alexa", "2013", 29, true]
["May", "2012B", 14, false]
["Deloise", "2012A", 19, true] 
```

Pros:

- Supports JSON Datatypes (Numbers, Bool, Null, etc.)


or nested data records e.g.

```
{"name": "Gilbert", "wins": [["straight", "7♣"], ["one pair", "10♥"]]}
{"name": "Alexa", "wins": [["two pair", "4♠"], ["two pair", "9♠"]]}
{"name": "May", "wins": []}
{"name": "Deloise", "wins": [["three of a kind", "5♣"]]}
```


### NDJSON 

_Newline Delmited JSON_

web: [ndjson.org](http://ndjson.org), 
github: [ndjson](https://github.com/ndjson)


1. Line Separator is '\n' 
2. Each Line is a valid JSON Value

```
{"some":"thing"}
{"foo":17,"bar":false,"quux":true}
{"may":{"include":"nested","objects":["and","arrays"]}}
```
