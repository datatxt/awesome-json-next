## Stage for Future Updates - What's News?

Rather than keep making new variants of JSON, it'd be nice if somebody could convince some mainstream language maintainers 
to just update their built-in JSON parser to add optional features like skipping over comments and not caring about trailing commas. Most parsers support various flags already to configure things, 
so there could just be an
- ALLOW_COMMENTS flag and 
- ALLOW_TRAILING_COMMAS flag.

### JSON with Commas and Comments (JWCC) 

> JWCC is a minimal extension to the widely used JSON file format with (1) optional commas after the final element of arrays 
> and objects and (2) C/C++ style comments. These two features make it more suitable for human-editable configuration files, 
> without adding so many features that itâ€™s incompatible with numerous other (deliberate and accidental) existing JSON extensions.

### JSONC - A Json like file format with comments

Jsonc is a simplified json format which allows comments and unquoted values delimited by whitespace. 
A jsonc formatted file can be transformed to a json file. Comments will be stripped out and quotes added.

Any valid json is also a valid jsonc - but this goes only in one direction.

Why? Json formatted files could be very handy to be used as config files. But the lack of comments and the redundancy of the format hurts readability.

```
{ /*
jsonc example
hit Format and check the json output
*/ // forgiving syntax

 hey:[this needs no commas ] // unquoted values

 give:[it,a,shot ] /* and lots of comments :) */ // try it for yourself

 "this":{
  "is":"also",
  "just":"a"
 },
 "json":"formatter"
}
```

### Visual Studio Code -JSON with Comments (JSONC)

- <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments>

In addition to the default JSON mode following the JSON specification, 
VS Code also has a JSON with Comments (jsonc) mode. 
This mode is used for the VS Code configuration files such as `settings.json`, `tasks.json`, or `launch.json`. 
When in the JSON with Comments mode, you can use single line (`//`) as well as block comments (`/* */`) 
as used in JavaScript. 


### Comment JSON   (Python commentjson module)

Add Python and JavaScript style comments in your JSON files.

```
{
    "name": "Vaidik Kapoor", # Person's name
    "location": "Delhi, India", // Person's location

    # Section contains info about
    // person's appearance
    "appearance": {
        "hair_color": "black",
        "eyes_color": "black",
        "height": "6"
    }
}
```

### Rapid JSON - Added relaxed JSON syntax (comment, trailing comma, NaN/Infinity)

- <http://rapidjson.org/md_doc_dom.html>


Relaxed JSON syntax:

- kParseCommentsFlag -	Allow one-line `//` ... and multi-line `/*` ... `*/` comments.
- kParseTrailingCommasFlag	- Allow trailing commas at the end of objects and arrays.
- kParseNanAndInfFlag	- Allow parsing NaN, Inf, Infinity, -Inf and -Infinity as double values.
- kParseEscapedApostropheFlag	- Allow escaped apostrophe `&rsquo;` in strings.


### Python JSON Built-In Extensions

It also understands NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity as their corresponding float values, 
which is outside the JSON spec.

> This module does not comply with the RFC in a strict fashion, 
> implementing some extensions that are valid JavaScript but not valid JSON. In particular:
>
> Infinite and NaN number values are accepted and output;
>
> Repeated names within an object are accepted, and only the value of the last name-value pair is used.
>
> Since the RFC permits RFC-compliant parsers to accept input texts 
> that are not RFC-compliant, this moduleâ€™s deserializer is technically RFC-compliant under default settings.

### CUE (Configure Unify Execute) - JSON Superset

- <https://cuelang.org/docs/tutorials/tour/intro/json/>

CUE (Configure Unify Execute) is a superset of JSON. It adds the following conveniences:

- C-style comments,
- quotes may be omitted from field names without special characters,
- commas at the end of fields are optional,
- comma after last element in list is allowed,
- outer curly braces are optional.

JSON objects are called structs in CUE. An object member is called a field.

```
one: 1
two: 2

// A field using quotes.
"two-and-a-half": 2.5

list: [
	1,
	2,
	3,
]
```

### Bits On the Wire (by Tim Bray)

<https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/11/17/Bits-On-the-Wire>

JSON pros:

- Readers and writers are implemented in every computer language known to humankind, and they tend to interoperate correctly and frictionlessly with each other, particularly if you follow the interoperability guidelines in RFC 8259, which all the software I use seems to.

- It does a pretty good job of modeling nested-record structures.

- It's all-text, so humans can read it, which is super extra helpful.

- You can receive a JSON message you know nothing about and pick it apart successfully without knowing its schema, assuming it has one, which it probably doesnâ€™t. So you can accomplish a task like "Pull out the item-count and item-price fields that are nested in the top-level order-detail field" with pretty good results given just a blob of raw JSON.

- You can reliably distinguish between numbers, strings, booleans, and null.


JSON cons:

- The type system is impoverished. There is no timestamp type, no way to know whether a number should be treated as an integer or float or Bignum, no way to signal when string values are really enums, and so on.

- Numbers are specially impoverished; in general you should assume that your repertoire is that of an IEEE double-precision float (but without NaN or âˆž) which is adequate for most purposes, as long as you're OK with an integer range of Â±253 (which you probably should be).

- Since JSON is textual, there is a temptation to edit it by hand, and this is painful since itâ€™s nearly impossible to get the commas in the right places. On top of which there are no comments.

- JSON's textuality, and the fact that it carries its field labels along, no matter how deeply nested and often repeated, suggest that it is unnecessarily verbose, particularly when numeric values are represented in textual form. Also, the text needs to be converted into binary form to be loaded into objects (or structs, or dicts) for processing by code in memory.

- JSON doesnâ€™t have a universally-accepted schema language. I have been publicly disappointed over "JSON Schema", the leading contender in that space; itâ€™s just not very good. For a long time, the popular Swagger (now OpenAPI) protocols for specifying APIs used a variant version of a years-old release of JSON Schema; those are stable and well-tooled.
